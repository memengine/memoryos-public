    question: "Do I need a credit card for the free plan?",
    answer:
      "No. You can start on the Free plan without a credit card and add billing only when you upgrade.",
  },
  {
    question: "What counts as an API call?",
    answer:
      "Each MemoryOS API request counts as one call, including writes, retrievals, and tenant operations.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when I hit my monthly limit?",
    answer:
      "Free plans pause API usage at the limit. Paid plans keep your AI product running without memory context until capacity is restored or the plan is upgraded.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I switch between monthly and annual billing?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can choose monthly or annual billing. Annual billing gives you two months free.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is data residency included?",
    answer:
      "All plans start in IN1. Enterprise customers can choose their preferred supported region.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which plans include Memory Passport?",
    answer:
      "Growth and Enterprise include Memory Passport features for cross-agent memory sharing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Billing is managed through Stripe Billing Portal, and your plan remains active until the end of the paid period.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer custom enterprise contracts?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Enterprise plans support custom limits, dedicated Slack support, regional choices, and custom procurement terms.",
